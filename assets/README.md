# Asset Directory

This directory contains game assets including textures, fonts, and other resources.

## Current Assets

- `README.md` - This file

## Planned Assets

### Textures
- Card front textures (ranks and suits)
- Card back texture
- Background texture
- UI elements

### Fonts
- Game UI font
- Score display font

## Asset Guidelines

- Use consistent resolution (e.g., 128x128 for card textures)
- PNG format with transparency support
- Power-of-2 dimensions for optimal OpenGL performance
- Consistent art style across all assets

## Placeholder Implementation

The current implementation generates simple colored textures programmatically. Replace these with actual artwork for production quality.

### Card Texture Format
- Front: Show rank and suit symbols
- Back: Uniform design with game branding
- Size: 80x120 pixels (maintaining card aspect ratio)
